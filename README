PYLDecider is a Python program that computes optimal strategy for playing
the game show 'Press Your Luck'.

To run it, just type 'python PylDecider.py'.

Edit the main function at the bottom of the file to set the initial
conditions.  A future enhancement would be to read in these conditions
from a file instead.

The simulation of the rules is complete, but some of the strategy
decisions are not completely implemented yet.
